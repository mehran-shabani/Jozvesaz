# Shared environment configuration for the monorepo services.
# Copy this file to `.env` and replace placeholder values with secure secrets.
#
# Versioning guidance:
# - Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` (or keep it encrypted) so secrets stay out of git history.
# - Distribute secrets through your secret manager or encrypted channels only.
# - When secrets rotate, update `.env` locally and refresh any dependent services.
#
# Container defaults. Override hosts/ports when deploying directly on a VM.
